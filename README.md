# MCCS Examples

MCCS (Molecular Complex Characterizing System) examples for papers published on BIB (Briefing in Bioinformatics)

## Example 1: [GPCR](https://github.com/stcmz/mccs-example-gpcr)

In this MCCS example, we used MCCS to perform systems pharmocological analysis on the determined X-ray-crystal or cryo-EM structures of G protein-coupled receptors. Please see our paper for detailed discussion.
